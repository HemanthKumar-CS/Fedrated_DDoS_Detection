## 🎯 Key Concepts Quick Reference

### What is DDoS?
- Distributed Denial of Service attack
- Multiple sources flood target with traffic
- Makes service unavailable to legitimate users
- Examples: UDP flood, TCP SYN flood, ICMP flood

### How Detection Works
```
Flow Features → Normalize → CNN Model → Score 0-1 → BENIGN or ATTACK
```

### The 30 Features Explained
```
Top 5 Most Important:
1. Flow Duration - How long the flow lasted
2. Fwd Packet Length Mean - Average size of forward packets
3. Packet Rate - Packets per second
4. Backward Packet Count - How many packets came back
5. Flow IAT Mean - Time between packets
```

### CNN Layers
```
Conv1D #1: Learns local patterns
Conv1D #2: Combines patterns
Conv1D #3: Learns complex relationships
Dense: Makes final decision
```

### Federated Learning
- Train on distributed data (clients keep raw data)
- Share only model weights (not data)
- Aggregate using Multi-Krum (Byzantine-robust)
- Privacy-preserving machine learning

### Multi-Krum Algorithm
- Calculate distances between client updates
- Select subset of closest/most similar clients
- Average their weights
- Filters out malicious/outlier clients

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What Data is Shared?
❌ NOT shared:
- Raw network traffic
- IP addresses of traffic
- Individual flow information
- Personal identifying information

✅ IS shared:
- Model weights (~2000-5000 numbers per round)
- Aggregated metrics (accuracy, loss)
- Model architecture (not data)

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Multi-Krum can tolerate up to `f` malicious clients
- Default: `f=0` (no tolerance, 4/4 must be honest)
- Can configure: `--f 1` (1 malicious client allowed)
- Filters outlier updates automatically

### Federated Privacy Benefits
- No raw data collection
- No central honeypot
- Distributed trust
- Compliant with data protection regulations

## 📞 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Address already in use" | Port 8080 occupied | `--address 127.0.0.1:8081` |
| "Connection refused" | Server not started | Start server before clients |
| "Feature mismatch" | Wrong feature count | Check `client_0_train.csv` columns |
| "Model not found" | Training incomplete | Run full training cycle |
| "Low accuracy" | Insufficient training | Increase epochs or rounds |
| "Slow training" | Resource constraint | Use GPU or reduce batch size |
| "Memory error" | Out of RAM | Process smaller batches |

### Getting Help
1. Check: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` troubleshooting section
