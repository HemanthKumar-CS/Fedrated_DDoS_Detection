## 1. Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a federated learning-based DDoS detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can effectively identify Distributed Denial of Service attacks in network traffic while preserving data privacy through distributed training.

### 🔧 Technology Stack
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
- **Federated Learning**: Flower (flwr) framework
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Environment**: Virtual environment with comprehensive ML libraries

### 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: CICIDDOS2019 Dataset
- **Original Size**: 23.9GB with 50M+ records
- **Optimized Size**: 2.24GB with 50K records (90% reduction)
- **Attack Types**: 11 different DDoS attack categories
- **Features**: 88 original features optimized to 30 features

## 2. Dataset Analysis

### 📈 Original Dataset Statistics

#### 2.1 Dataset Composition
```
Original CICIDDOS2019 Dataset:
├── Total Records: 50,006,249
├── File Size: 23.9GB
├── Features: 88 network flow features
├── Classes: 11 different attack types + 1 benign class
└── Format: CSV files (01-12 folder structure)
```

#### 2.2 Attack Type Distribution
The dataset contains the following attack types:
- **BENIGN**: Normal network traffic
- **DrDoS_DNS**: DNS-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_LDAP**: LDAP-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_MSSQL**: MSSQL-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_NetBIOS**: NetBIOS-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_NTP**: NTP-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_SNMP**: SNMP-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_SSDP**: SSDP-based DRDoS attacks
- **DrDoS_UDP**: UDP-based DRDoS attacks
- **Syn**: SYN flood attacks
- **TFTP**: TFTP-based attacks
- **UDPLag**: UDP lag attacks

#### 2.3 Critical Dataset Issue Discovered
During initial analysis, we discovered a critical bias in the preprocessing pipeline:

**Problem**: The original optimization script only included attack samples, completely excluding benign traffic.
- Original optimized dataset: 100% attack samples (0% benign)
- This led to unrealistic 100% accuracy in initial training

**Solution**: Created a balanced dataset with proper representation:
- Balanced dataset: 50% benign + 50% attack samples
- Total samples: 50,000 (25,000 benign + 25,000 attack)

## 3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### 🔄 Preprocessing Steps

#### 3.1 Data Optimization Process
```python
# Optimization Pipeline Summary
Original Dataset (23.9GB) 
    ↓ [Sample Selection]
Sampled Dataset (2.24GB - 50K records)
    ↓ [Feature Engineering]
Optimized Features (88 → 30 features)
    ↓ [Balance Correction]
Balanced Dataset (25K benign + 25K attack)
    ↓ [Normalization]
Training-Ready Dataset
```

#### 3.2 Feature Engineering

**Original Features (88)**: Network flow statistics including:
- Packet counts and sizes
- Flow duration and rates
- Protocol-specific features
- Statistical measures (mean, std, min, max)

**Optimized Features (30)**: Selected based on:
- Statistical significance
- Correlation analysis
- Feature importance scores
- Computational efficiency

**Key Optimized Features**:
1. `Flow Duration`
2. `Total Fwd Packets`
3. `Total Backward Packets`
4. `Total Length of Fwd Packets`
5. `Total Length of Bwd Packets`
6. `Fwd Packet Length Max/Min/Mean/Std`
7. `Bwd Packet Length Max/Min/Mean/Std`
8. `Flow Bytes/s` and `Flow Packets/s`
9. `Flow IAT Mean/Std/Max/Min`
10. Various statistical measures

#### 3.3 Data Balancing Strategy

**Before Balancing**:
```
Class Distribution (Original Optimized):
├── BENIGN: 0 samples (0%)
└── ATTACK: 50,000 samples (100%)
Result: Unrealistic 100% accuracy
```

**After Balancing**:
```
Class Distribution (Balanced):
├── BENIGN: 25,000 samples (50%)
└── ATTACK: 25,000 samples (50%)
Result: Realistic 91.27% accuracy
```

#### 3.4 Feature Normalization
- **Method**: StandardScaler (z-score normalization)
- **Formula**: z = (x - μ) / σ
- **Purpose**: Ensure all features contribute equally to model training
- **Result**: Features scaled to mean=0, std=1

#### 3.5 Data Splitting for Federated Learning
```
Federated Data Distribution:
├── Client 0: 12,500 samples (balanced)
├── Client 1: 12,500 samples (balanced)
├── Client 2: 12,500 samples (balanced)
├── Client 3: 12,500 samples (balanced)
└── Test Set: 10,000 samples (separate)
