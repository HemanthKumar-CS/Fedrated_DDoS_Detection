âœ… BALANCED DATASET READY FOR FEDERATED LEARNING!

This dataset now contains both benign and attack samples, creating a realistic
binary classification problem. The 100% accuracy issue has been resolved.

Next steps:
1. Run federated training with balanced model
2. Use balanced_dataset.csv for centralized training
3. Use client_*_train.csv and client_*_test.csv for FL simulation
